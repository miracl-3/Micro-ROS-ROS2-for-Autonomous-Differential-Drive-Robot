# Overview
This project serves as an intermediate practice in using ROS 2 and its relevant packages. The current focus is on tasks such as evaluating odometry accuracy with the help of the robot_localization package.

# Hardware Architecture
The system is built around a simple yet functional hardware setup:

üß† Microcontroller: ESP32-WROOM-32D

üñ•Ô∏è Companion Computer: Raspberry Pi 5 running Ubuntu 24.04 (Jazzy)

‚öôÔ∏è Motors: 2 DC Encoder Motors

üîå Motor Driver: L298N

üì° IMU - BNO008X (https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/32983637871.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2vnm)

# Development Roadmap
If the initial phase progresses successfully, we plan to extend the project by integrating a Camera Module for Visual Odometry and perception tasks.

# Purpose 
This repository aims to:
- Provide a reference for students and hobbyists working on similar ROS 2-based differential drive platforms
- Share practical insights into configuring odometry, sensor fusion, and system integration in ROS 2
# CONTRIBUTION
If you find this project helpful or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
